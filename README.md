# Image-processing
Image processing is a field of signal processing focused on analyzing and manipulating digital images. It involves the manipulation of images using mathematical operations and algorithms to enhance, compress, restore, or extract information from images.
Here are some common techniques:

Image Enhancement: This involves improving the visual appearance of an image for human perception or for better processing by machines. Techniques include:

Histogram Equalization
Contrast Stretching
Spatial Filtering (e.g., using convolution)
Adaptive Filtering
Noise Reduction (e.g., using filters like Gaussian or median filters)
Image Restoration: This aims to improve the quality of an image by removing artifacts or distortions caused by the imaging process or transmission. Techniques include:

Image Deconvolution
Inpainting
Denoising
Super-resolution
Image Compression: This reduces the size of an image by removing redundant or irrelevant information while preserving essential details. Techniques include:

Lossy Compression (e.g., JPEG)
Lossless Compression (e.g., PNG)
Wavelet-based Compression (e.g., JPEG2000)
Image Segmentation: This involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation for analysis. Techniques include:

Thresholding
Clustering (e.g., K-means clustering)
Edge Detection (e.g., using Sobel or Canny edge detectors)
Region Growing
Feature Extraction: This extracts meaningful information or features from images for further analysis or classification tasks. Techniques include:

Corner Detection (e.g., Harris corner detector)
Blob Detection
Texture Analysis
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
Image Registration: This aligns multiple images of the same scene or object to facilitate comparison or fusion. Techniques include:

Point-based Registration
Intensity-based Registration
Feature-based Registration
Morphological Processing: This involves extracting features of interest from images based on shapes and structures. Techniques include:

Erosion and Dilation
Opening and Closing
Hit-or-Miss Transformation
Skeletonization
Deep Learning-Based Techniques: With the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other architectures are increasingly used for various image processing tasks, such as classification, object detection, and segmentation.

These techniques are often used in combination to achieve specific goals in various applications, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, surveillance, robotics, and more.
